Description: This package provides an extensible collection of utilities for 
    programatically working with operators that appear in language objects 
    such as formulas, calls and expresions.  Various routines allow operations 
    classifying and determining an operator type, translating between an 
    operator and its underlying function, and inverting certain types of 
    operators, etc. All of these can be applied to new/custom infix operators.
