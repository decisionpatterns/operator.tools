Description: This package provides an extensible collection of utilities for 
    programming with operators that appear in language objects such as formulas,
    calls and expressions. Various routines allow operations 
    classifying operators, translating between an operator and its underlying 
    function, and inverting some types of operators, etc. All methods 
    can be extended to custom infix operators.
